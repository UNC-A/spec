UNCA OPEN SPEC DOCUMENT

### Preamble
If you've read a OPENSPEC document before you can skip this part. 
- Communication is documented from the perspective of the client unless specified otherwise data is represented by JSON/BSONs with comments for clarity of specifics (e.g. u16 instead of u32). 
- Data {surronded by brackets} reperesent variables and UPPERCASE represent constants. 
- When documenting interactions the standard follows "Collection; Action". for example Message; Send. 
- If an item in the JSON has the nullable* comment it means that at least ONE of the nullable* fields MUST be present.
